                    <p class="lead mt-3">As Potterheadsü™Ñ, our team wanted to explore the various relationships in the Harry Potter universe using quantitative methods. We were specifically interested in analyzing the differences in values between the views of the author, movie directors and the fanbase in Harry Potter. How does J.K. Rowling choose romantic pairings? Which characters have made the greatest impression on the fans? And is there a correlation to be found between these factors?                    </p>

                    <p class="lead mt-3">We decided to focus our attention on the movie scripts of the franchise, and webscrapped them from a fan-hosted <a class="not-header" href="https://zynang.github.io/ny-redesign/">Warner Bros Entertainment Wiki</a>. We also webscraped the results of a fan vote from an <a class="not-header" href="https://www.imdb.com/poll/cccGe9D3x18/results?ref_=po_sr">IMDB poll</a>, for our analysis of the correlation between character appearances and popularity among the fanbase.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead mt-3">We used Python's BeautifulSoup package to parse the HTML of the wiki site and scrape all information related to the script, including scene data, speakers and dialogue. We used the same strategy to collect data on fan votes from the IMDB poll.</p>

                    <p class="lead mt-3">We cleaned the raw data, then converted and sorted them into SQL databases for easy querying and manipulation.</p>

                    <p class="lead mt-3">We used Python's SciPy and Scikit-Learn libraries to conduct these tests. Below is a more in-depth discussion of our rationale for each of these tests. Feel free to skip to <a class="not-header js-scroll-trigger" href="#results">Results!</a></p>
                    <h4 class="section-header">Hypothesis #1</h4>
                    <p class="lead mt-3">To test this hypothesis, we used Kendall's Rank Corrrelation Test. We used this statistical test because</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="p lead mt-3"><b>Continuous / Ordinal Variables:</b> The variables are continuous and Kendall's is suitable for measuring the relationship between 2 continuous variables</li>
                        <li class="p lead mt-3"><b>Variables are NOT normally distributed:</b> The distribution of the variables instead resemble negative exponential distributions with a few outliers</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="lead mt-3">We also considered Chi-Squared Independence Tests and Pearson's Correlation, but those tests were not suitable for the distribution and nature of our variables.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-header">Hypothesis #2</h4>
                        <p class="lead mt-3">To test this hypothesis, we used Kendall's Rank Corrrelation Test and Linear Regression. We chose Kendall's Rank test because of the same rationale as above. As for linear regression, we used it because it is suitable for correlation testing.</p>
                        
                        <p class="lead mt-3">We also attempted Kmeans clustering on the dataset using these two variables as the axis but ran into an issue where it created clusters that were much closer in similarity than we expected and appeared partially random.</p>

                    <h4 class="section-header">Hypothesis #3</h4>
                        <p class="lead mt-3">To test this hypothesis, we used a Point Biserial Test. We used this statistical test because</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="p lead mt-3"><b>Continuous Variable and Dichotomous Variable:</b> The variables in our test are continous (the number of times two characters share a scene) and dichotomous (the presence of a romantic relationship between them). The point-biserial test is specially designed to derive the correlation of 2 such variables</li>
                            <li class="p lead mt-3"><b>Variables are NOT normally distributed:</b> Although the point-biserial is considered a special case of Pearsons correlation, it does not necessarily assume that the continuous variable follows a normal distribution. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that it is classically used to measure data with normal distributions</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="lead mt-3">We also considered Mutual Information, but were unable to obtain meaningful results from the test.</p>

                    <h4 class="section-header">Hypothesis #4</h4>
                    <p class="lead mt-3">To test this hypothesis, we used Linear Regression. We chose linear regression, because it is suitable for correlation testing.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead mt-3">We also considered clustering to see if there were certain distinct groupings of characters (ex. minor vs main characters), but we thought that linear regression would have the most insights.</p>

                    <p class="lead mt-3 ">I really enjoyed working on this project, because it allowed me to use practical data science skills on a topic that was interesting and enjoyable for me. The Harry Potter universe was a significant part of my childhood, and there were questions about the franchise that I've wondered about for a while that I managed to answer in this project through the use of data analysis.

                    <p class="h4 section-header">Future Direction</p>
                    <p class="lead mt-3 "> To further iterate and improve on this project, I would work to expand the database so as to fill in all the gaps of missing information. I am also keen to use machine learning to conduct predictive analysis on questions such as the likelihood of a romantic relationship forming between two characters, or predicting if they would make it till the end of the series (or be unalived by JK Rowling) </p>
