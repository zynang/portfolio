                        In this project, I worked with three other students to design a way for caregivers to be involved in the medicare enrollment journey of Uno Health members. Such a capability would allow members that are less tech savvy to navigate the digital process with greater ease. <br>  Using sketches, low fidelity wireframes, and eventually a high fidelity Figma prototype, we iterated on this design, incorporating feedback from our classmates, professors, and the lead designer at Uno Health. We believe that our final product is a strong solution to the problem we set out to solve.

                    <p class="lead mt-3"> <a class="not-header" href="https://www.unohealth.com/">Uno Health</a> is a startup that aims to improve access to Medicare by increasing the ease with which people can apply for Medicare savings. Half of Medicare members are currently eligible for state and federal financial assistance, and yet are not enrolled in these life-changing assistance programs.
                    <br>
                    Many Medicare members have caregivers or family members who help them manage their healthcare and finances. However, Uno Health’s digital service currently has <b>little support for allowing caregivers to be involved in the enrollment process for Medicare members</b>. 
                    <br>As such, group was tasked with designing a mobile interface to help Uno reach this exact population- Caregivers!

We focused on increasing accessibility, and creating a way for less tech-savvy users to still benefit from Uno. We chose to create a flow which allowed caregivers to enroll their caree in Uno, without requiring the Caree to sign up for a separate Uno account by themselves. This improved on our previous flow, which required the linking of Caregiver/Caree accounts. </p>

                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <ol class="multi-use">
                        <li>A separate Caregiver account. Our flow includes a separate caregiver account so that existing members do not have to share an account with their caregiver and relinquish all their personal information, and non members are given the option to either create an account and link it to their caregivers, or have their caregiver manage their Uno journey on their behalf. </li>
                        <li>Consistent use of color to create a cohesive and visually-appealing design. Color is used to distinguish between the portals (caregiver, caree), and their different states (linked to another account, proxy account, etc.)
                        </li>
                        <li>Dropdown menus for accessibility. We included a dropdown to allow users to select their preferred font size for the webpage, and change the language if required. We also included a 'Read Aloud' screen reader.
                        </li>
                        <li>Exit points for the user. In various frames of the design,  we gave users the ability to skip steps or exit if they chose to. This provides users with control over their experience, and a way for users to escape from tasks that are not working for them at the moment.
                        </li>
                        <li>Different types of consent procedures. To account for the different user flows, we have different ways to request consent from the Caree before sharing information with the Caregiver. If the Caree as an Uno account, we send them an in-app notification. Else, we use text messages/email to make sure consent is provided.
                        </li>

The iterative process helped us refine our design, and I learnt the importance of constructive feedback! With this experience, I have become more skilled at Figma and working in a team of other designers. ⁺˚⋆｡°✩₊</p>
